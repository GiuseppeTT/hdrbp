# hdrbp

This repository holds the source code for a python package developed for my research. Its purpose is to simulate the performance of high-dimensional risk-based portfolios (HDRBP) using data free of survivorship bias. For this purpose, I implemented state of the art covariance matrix estimators and optimized for speed.

For a quick demonstration, you can run the script `example.py`.
